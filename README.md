# Lambda-Challenge
This repository stores an accepting solution for the lambda calculus challenge. The challenge is provided by the online judge "Hangzhou Dianzi University Online Judge 3.0" at: http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/showproblem.php?pid=5987 . The solution was implemented by me.

By the time the acceptance was achieved, the judge had a total amount of submissions of 1304 for this challenge, but only 82 accepted submissions (it is not easy to solve).
